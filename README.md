𝗕𝗮𝘀𝗶𝗰 𝗙𝘂𝗻𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆:
- Created a Python script to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- Implemented a graphical user interface (GUI) using PyQt.
- Ensured error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero.
𝗕𝗼𝗻𝘂𝘀 𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀:
- Included additional functions such as square root, exponentiation, and trigonometric operations (sin, cos, tan).

𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗛𝗶𝗴𝗵𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀:
𝗚𝗨𝗜 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗣𝘆𝗤𝘁:
- Designed a user-friendly interface with a sleek, modern look using PyQt.
- Added buttons for digits, operators, and functions, styled with CSS for better visual appeal.

𝗘𝗿𝗿𝗼𝗿 𝗛𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴:
- Implemented robust error handling to manage invalid inputs and prevent crashes.
- Provided clear error messages for division by zero and other invalid operations.

𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗲𝘀 𝗙𝗮𝗰𝗲𝗱:
- Integrating PyQt for the GUI and ensuring cross-platform compatibility.
- Handling complex mathematical expressions and ensuring accurate results. (I still wasn't able to integrate the functionality of exponent (e))
- Styling the application to make it visually appealing and user-friendly.
- Managing edge cases such as division by zero and invalid inputs effectively.
